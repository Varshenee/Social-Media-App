# Social-Media-App

📌 Aim

To develop a social media app that allows users to:

Sign up and log in

View posts by other users

Post text or images

Have a profile with a bio and profile picture

Scroll through a home feed

🛠️ Tech Stack

Flutter (Developed in Android Studio)

Firebase (Planned for database integration but not fully implemented due to dependency errors)

🚀 Features

User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in.

Home Feed: A scrollable feed where all posts are visible.

Post Creation: Users can create posts with text (image upload is not functional due to issues with image_picker).

Profile Page: Displays user information, bio, and past posts.

Theming: The app follows a pink hearts theme.

⚠️ Current Limitations

Firebase integration is incomplete due to dependency and version errors.

Image uploading via image_picker is not working.

📌 Next Steps

Fix Firebase dependency issues to enable data persistence.

Resolve image_picker issues for image uploads.

Implement additional features like comments, likes, and notifications.
