# Social-Media-App

Aim: To make a social media app that allows user to login, sign-up, view posts by other people, post text or images, and have a profile. Firebase integration should be done.

Technical requirements: Used flutter in android studio and tried firebase integration for database.

Result: Succesfully made an app that allows user login and sign-up. The theme of the app is pink hearts. The app has a home feed that has all the posts visible to the user. The user can scroll and view the posts. The profile icon is in the home page that leads to the profile page when clicked on. The profile page allows the user to add bio, profile picture and view the posts made by the user. The user can click the post button on the home page and post texts(image picker didn't work). The final app lacks firebase integration due to several dependecy errors and version errors. Those are yet to be resolved.
